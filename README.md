## Leetcode



### General Pointer:
- Try to figure out/understand time complexity of your solution, and look for ways with which it can be reduced.
- Same for space complexity.

### Ask the interviewer:
-  Make no assumption about the problem. Ask clarifying questions to the interviewer wherever required.
-  Always ask the interviewer if algo needs to be optimized for space/time.   
-  Run by him a few base/edge cases to better understand the problem. 
-  Think a bit about the solution. Organize your thoughts. Vocalize them. This shows that you're a strong communicator[Thanks to *Daily Coding Problem* for this]
-  Then think of a pseudocode(a higher level solution). Never begin writing the actual code before these steps.
-  After writing the solution, think of test cases and run them through your interviewer. 
-  Be prepared for some follow-up question from your interviewer.(what other solutions are there? how can we improve this for time/space?)
