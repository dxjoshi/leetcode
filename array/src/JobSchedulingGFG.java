Given a set of N jobs where each jobi has a deadline and profit associated with it.

Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time. We earn the profit associated with job if and only if the job is completed by its deadline.

Find the number of jobs done and the maximum profit.

Note: Jobs will be given in the form (Jobid, Deadline, Profit) associated with that Job.
